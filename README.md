# Camera-Calibration
Common Pole-Polar Properties of Central Catadioptric Sphere and Line Images Used for Camera Calibration.
This is the simulation code. We will publish the source code and dataset once the paper is accepted.

If you wan to test the calibration method based on spheres, just run cali_sphere.m.
If you wan to test the calibration method based on lines, just run cali_line.m.
